# CS225-Shell-Scripting
This repository contains my solutions for the CS253 shell scripting assignment. The project includes two main shell scripts—`larger.sh` and `main.sh`—that automate text processing and log analysis tasks by utilizing common shell utilities such as `sed`, `grep`, `awk`, as well as output redirection methods.
